# Paper Airplane Numerical Study
  Final Project: AEM 3103 Spring 2024

  - By: Zachary Elliott and Wesley Girardi

  ## Summary of Findings
  <Show the variations studied in a table>

  Summarized what was accomplished in this study.  Describe 2-4 observations from simulating the flight path.
  Reference the figures below as needed.

  *If the analysis falls short of the goal, this is your chance to explain what was done or what were the barriers.*
 
  # Code Listing
  A list of each function/script and a single-line description of what it does.  The name of the function/script should link to the file in the repository on GitHub.

  2D trajectory simulated by varying single parameter at at time
  <The above plot should also show the nominal trajectory>

  Briefly describe what is being shown in the figure.

  ## Fig. 2: Monte Carlo Simulation

  # Animation
  ## Point-Mass Animation
  <Animated GIF showing 2D trajectory for nominal and the scenario (V=7.5 m/s, Gam=+0.4 rad)>
  
  (Below are for teams of 3 people)
  ## Graphical Animation
  <Same as the above animation, except that the moving *point* should be a 2D drawing of an airplane, drawn using CAD>
